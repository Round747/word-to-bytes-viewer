# Word, Byte & Bit To Decimal
Lets you view words with the values of their bytes and bits. Can set both the bits and the decimal values to change the result.

I wrote this in a evening because I needed something like this for a project I'm working on.

All the other bit viewers online did not let you view the 8-bit value of the second byte within a word. Since My project split words into to bytes, i needed to see what the 16-bit value was with the combination of two decimals.
